# Lunar Vim Keys
Lunar vim is a dramework for neovim which is a terminal text editor.

This is a list full of lunarvim keybinds and commands.
Few of these keys are specific to my configratuon, thus a braket is next to it to suggest the actual command/ keys.
If you would like you can cutomize it and anything else in the `config.lua`
## Leader
Leader is a key to initlize some commands, in this config is the 'spacebar', you can customise it to be '/' if you would like.

In this document it is addressed as `<leader>`

Also a neat feature about lunar vim is pressing the `<leader>` will opena pane after 1 second which shows all the commands mapped to it (with descriptions),
pressing one will run it or if it has a sub command it will show more commands. Try doing `<leader>-g` to show all the git commands.
